## Project Intent:<br>
To enable individuals with one hand disabilities to type at the same speed as the general population, the goal is to develop one-handed keyboard software.<br>
<br>
## Objectives:<br>
1, Achieving identical typing speed and text composition as that of the general population.<br>
2, Simplifying shortcuts that are challenging to input with one hand.<br>
## Key Principles:<br>
Leveraging the repetitive nature of Korean consonants and vowels, the keyboard layout automatically alternates between left and right sides, allowing one-handed typing.<br>
<br>
## Advantages:<br>
### 1, Speed: 
Fast typing speed, requiring only 7 additional inputs compared to the general population for a 300-character sample.<br>
### 2, Accessibility: 
No need to learn a new layout other than the existing one.<br>
### 3, Affordability: 
Significantly lower cost compared to hardware solutions.<br>
### 4, Portability: 
Convenient to carry as it is software-based.<br>
## Key Features:<br>
### 1, Keyboard Layout Change:<br>
Enables switching between keyboard layouts.<br>
### 2, Registration of Challenging Shortcuts on the Unused Opposite Side:<br>
Allows registering shortcuts that are difficult to input with one hand on the unused opposite side.<br>
### 3, Manual Key Registration for Language Switching:<br>
Permits manual switching between left and right for foreign language input.<br>
<br>
Note: The project is designed to enhance accessibility and typing efficiency for individuals with one hand disabilities by adapting the keyboard layout to their unique needs, providing a more inclusive digital experience.
